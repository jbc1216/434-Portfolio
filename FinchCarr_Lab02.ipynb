    "- In the hypothetical telescope I'm using, there is a background of cosmic-rays (electrons and protons, mostly) that provides a discrete noise term across the sky that precisely follows a Poisson distribution. To detect a gamma-ray source, I am asking what is the probability that the cosmic-ray background would have given me a measurement as signal-like or more than the signal that you received.\n",
    "  - I assume that in 1 day, the average cosmic-ray background labelled $x$, which is equal to 3\n",
    "  - I also assume that in 1 day, the average amount of gamma particles emitted from this source is labelled $y$, which is equal to 8\n",
    "    - So I want to know what the probability is that the background Poisson distribution would give me a signal that is greater than or equal to my measurement of $y=8$\n",
    "    \n",
    "- First, I want to show how the Poisson-distributed background changes as I sum for it over an increasing number of days\n",
    "  - I can show this change by taking my background and convolving it with itself several times over, and plotting the results"
